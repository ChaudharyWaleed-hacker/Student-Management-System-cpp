# Student Management System (C++)

## 📌 Project Overview
This is a **console-based Student Management System** developed in C++.  
It allows users to manage student records efficiently, including storing information, calculating GPA, assigning grades, generating reports, and analyzing performance.

The system uses **structures** and **dynamic memory allocation** to handle multiple students and subjects.

## 📚 How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Make sure you have `students.txt` in the same folder as the code.  
   - First line: number of students and subjects  
   - Following lines: student ID, name, and marks for each subject  
3. Compile the `main.cpp` file using a C++ compiler. Example:

   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o StudentManagement
Run the program:

./StudentManagement
Follow the menu options to:

Access data from the file

Get topper list

Search or update student info

View pass/fail ratio and subject averages

Generate or save reports

📂 Sample Files
students.txt → contains sample student data

Report.txt → student-wise report generated by the program

General_report.txt → class performance report generated by the program

💡 Notes
Maximum number of students: 54

Maximum number of subjects: 8

GPA is calculated on a 4.0 scale

Grades are assigned automatically based on GPA
